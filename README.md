Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

- Inside the *models* directory you can found the Keras H5 models saved from the notebook file
- Inside the *hex* direcotry there is the binary of the  **[demo](https://youtu.be/990TrZHKTyQ)** I realize


Based on **[this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/)** excellent works
