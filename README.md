# STM32F769I-Disco_ML
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

- Inside the *models* directory you can found the Keras H5 models saved from the notebook file
- Inside the *hex* direcotry there is the binary of the  **[demo](https://youtu.be/990TrZHKTyQ)** I realize


Based on **[this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/)** excellent works, I realize this **[notebook](https://github.com/cledic/STM32F769I-Disco_ML/blob/master/Mnist_Keras.ipynb)** for saving the **[model](https://github.com/cledic/STM32F769I-Disco_ML/blob/master/models/Mnist_Keras.h5)** in H5 format. Then I use STM32Cube.AI to import the model and generate the source to realize my demo. 

Inside the *src* direcotry there are two _.c_ files.
